#Mike Naughton
##*Software Engineer, Entrepreneur, Dreamer*

**Goal**: To continue experiencing and contributing to awesome things as long as I live.

**Experience**: I've done more than you can imagine in my twenty-one years of life. No matter the reason you're reading this, you won't be disappointed.

**Leadership**: I've been active in Alpha Phi Omega since spring of 2010. We do service. We become leaders. We become friends. And I've done all three.

**Academics**: Close to a dual degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering, with a minor in Psychology, at Iowa State University. My GPA is obnoxiously high, I've been on the Dean's List numerous times, and I'm a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

**Interests**: Traveling, laughing, dancing, building, inventing, and doing awesome things. Working for you should fit into one or more of these categories.

**Current Skills**: I write and design code. If I don't know the language or paradigm, I'll learn it. I love beautiful software architectures, and programming with Xcode makes me all tingly inside.

**Other Skills**: Business planning, making professional connections, finding resources, learning, and being awesome.

**Why am I applying?** Because you're awesome. And your company is awesome. Good enough?

**Why should you hire me?** Just look at this resume; I know my trade very well, and I'm not afraid to think outside the box. And I love puppies.
